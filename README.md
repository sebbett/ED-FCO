Elite Dangerous Fleet Carrier Operations bot for Discord

This bot addresses an issue I've had with tools that try to achieve more automation. This sacrifices automation
to allow you to quickly and easily update subscribed parties on the movements of your fleet carrier.

Subscriptions to specific carriers allow you to control what carriers you receive updates for and in what channels.

Notify players that your carrier will be jumping and where

To Do:
Detail services currently active on the carrier
Allow for updating on location
Allow for status querying from other players
